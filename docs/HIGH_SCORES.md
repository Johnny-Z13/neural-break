## Online vs Local Scores

### Local Development

**Storage:** Browser localStorage  
**Visibility:** Only you (per browser/device)  
**Persistence:** Until browser data cleared  
**Best for:** Testing, offline play  

### Vercel Deployment

**Storage:** Global API endpoint  
**Visibility:** All players worldwide 🌐  
**Persistence:** In-memory (resets on deploy) or KV (permanent)  
**Best for:** Competition, leaderboards  

**The game automatically detects the environment!**

## Qualifying for Leaderboard

### Requirements

✅ Complete a full game (no quitting early)  
✅ Score higher than 10th place (if board is full)  
✅ Enter a valid name  

### What Counts

✅ All enemy kills  
✅ Multiplier bonuses  
✅ Combo bonuses  
✅ Survival time bonuses  
✅ Level completion bonuses  

### What Doesn't Count

❌ Test mode scores (not shown)  
❌ Paused time  
❌ Cheated scores (validation in place)

## Score Calculation

### Base Score

- **Enemy Kills**: Points per enemy type
  - DataMite: 100 pts
  - ScanDrone: 200 pts
  - ChaosWorm: 300 pts
  - VoidSphere: 250 pts
  - Crystal Swarm: 150 pts each
  - Fizzer: 500 pts (bonus enemy!)
  - UFO: 400 pts
  - Boss: 1000 pts

### Multiplier System

**Builds with consecutive kills:**
- No hits taken → Multiplier increases
- Hit taken → Multiplier resets to 1x

**Maximum:** 10x multiplier

**Score Calculation:**
```
Kill Score = Base Points × Current Multiplier
```

### Combo Bonuses

**Quick consecutive kills:**
- 3+ kills within 1 second = Combo!
- Each combo kill adds bonus
- Higher combos = bigger bonuses

### Survival Bonus

**Time-based scoring:**
- +100 pts per 10 seconds survived
- Encourages aggressive play
- Rewards risky strategies

### Level Bonuses

**Completing objectives:**
- Level 1-3: +500 pts each
- Level 4-6: +1000 pts each
- Level 7-9: +2000 pts each
- Level 10+: +5000 pts each

## Leaderboard Strategy

### Maximize Your Score

- Don't get hit!
- Chain kills rapidly
- Use dash to avoid damage
- Collect shields before boss fights

**Combo Chains:**
- Group enemies together
- Use explosive attacks
- Clear swarms quickly
- Plan enemy routes

**Risk vs Reward:**
- Fizzers are worth it (500 pts + high multiplier)
- Don't chase low-value targets
- Sometimes retreat to maintain streak

**Level Strategy:**
- Complete objectives fast for time bonus
- Farm enemies in safe areas
- Save power-ups for bosses
- Don't waste time on stragglers

## Tie-Breaking

If two scores are equal:
1. **Higher Level** wins
2. If level equal: **Longer Survival Time** wins
3. If time equal: **Newer Entry** wins

---

## Data Privacy

### What's Stored

✅ Name (3 letters only)  
✅ Score, level, time  
✅ Date played  
✅ General location (city)  
✅ Game mode  

### What's NOT Stored

❌ Email or personal info  
❌ IP address  
❌ Precise GPS location  
❌ Browser fingerprint  

**Location:** Uses browser's geolocation API (city-level only), with your permission. Shows "ONLINE" if location disabled.

## Leaderboard Etiquette

### Do:
✅ Use appropriate names  
✅ Play fair  
✅ Celebrate good scores  
✅ Learn from top players  

### Don't:
❌ Use offensive names  
❌ Spam submissions  
❌ Cheat or exploit  
❌ Submit fake scores

## Troubleshooting

### Score Not Saving

**Check:**
1. Completed full game (didn't quit early)
2. Score high enough for top 10
3. Entered valid name
4. Internet connection (if online)

**Try:**
- Refresh page and play again
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify localStorage not disabled

### Different Scores on Different Devices

**Cause:** Using localStorage (local mode)

**Solution:** Deploy to Vercel for global scores

### Scores Reset After Deployment

**Cause:** Using in-memory storage

**Solution:** Upgrade to Vercel KV for permanent storage
